# PAI Lab assignment (lab, class presentation with slides) structure

This directory is organised as follows:

      .
      ├── bib          # Assignment bibliography
      ├── report       # LaTeX template for the report
      ├── slides       # LaTeX Beamer template for the slides
      ├── tests        # Source code for tests
      ├── src          # Source code

For each assignment there should be a markdown file with the assignment description.
Find that file and follow the instructions in it.

When the evaluation session of the assignment is over, **do not forget** to upload the link to your repository to the virtual classroom.
